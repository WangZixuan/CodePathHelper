# CodePathHelper
![Icon](./CodePathHelper/Resources/Icon.png)

Makes it super easy to share code path of Azure DevOps, or go to the file given Azure DevOps link.

## Usage:

- Download and install from [Visual Studio Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Zixuan-Wang.codepathhelper).
- Select code, right click, "Share Code Path". The generated url will be copied to your clipboard.
- Tools -> "Goto Code Path", paste the Azure DevOps link, Visual Studio will help you navigate to the file and the line.
- More options can be viewed in Tools -> Options -> Extensions -> Code Path Helper

## Attention
- Git is involved in almost every step, but please pay attention to any possible mismatches in branches: remote VS local branch, your local branch VS branch in Url shared by others, etc.

## Roadmap
- Add icons
- Multi language support
- Customized shortcut support
- Highlight code from Url
- Extend to other git service provider: GitHub, GitLab, etc.
